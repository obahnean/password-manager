This is a Graphic User Interface project that represents a Password Manager. It allows me to manage my passwords and save
them into a json file. Again this is just a personal project and for my own use I do not need to worry about if anyone will
see my passwords since that file is stored on my computer.
 It allows me to find passwords attatched to a specific account by writing the Website Name and press Search
 I can also generate a safe password and store it as corresponding to a website account
 
 Please look on the pass1, pass2, pass3 images for a better understanding.
 To run the project, you can use an IDE or through the command line. Make sure you have python3 installed.
